### About
Matilda is a Material Design theme for Bootstrap 4. The goals of this project are to provide a theme that looks similar to Material Guidelines, but not to overdose it with complexity. There's also won't be any additional JavaScript plugins, so you can use Matilda flawlessly with any framework like Angular or React.
